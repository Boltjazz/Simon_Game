# Simon Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Simon Game**, created as part of my learning journey. This project helped me reinforce my understanding of JavaScript, jQuery, and the Document Object Model (DOM) and
a fun game to play.

## Demo

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**
- **jQuery**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

## Features
- **Interactive Game**: Players must remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that get progressively longer and faster.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Visual and Audio Feedback**: Each color has a corresponding sound and light effect.

## What I Learned

### JavaScript
- Implemented game logic using JavaScript functions, loops, and conditionals.
- Managed game state, including tracking the sequence, player input, and the current level.

### jQuery
- Used jQuery to manipulate the DOM efficiently.
- Handled user interactions such as clicks and keypress events.
- Applied animations and effects to enhance user experience.

### DOM Manipulation
- Dynamically updated the game board based on user interactions and game progress.
- Controlled the visibility and content of HTML elements using DOM methods.
- Leveraged event listeners to react to user input in real-time.

### Key Concepts
- **Functions**: Broke down the game logic into modular, reusable functions.
- **Arrays**: Stored the game sequence and player input using arrays.
- **Events**: Captured and responded to user actions, making the game interactive.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Boltjazz/Simon_Game.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd simon-game
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors flash on the screen.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. The game gets progressively more challenging as the sequence grows longer.
5. If you repeat the sequence correctly, you advance to the next level. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and you can start over.
